<p>Loading this project creates a Database schema called Football. The schema has 3 tables: 
<ul>
	<li><b>League</b> which represents a league season.</li>
	<li><b>Team</b> which represents a football club.</li>   
	<li><b>Fixture</b> which represents details of a football match.</li>   
</ul>
</p>
<p>The database is created empty. The status bar at the bottom of this page should show:<br/> 
seasons: 0 teams: 0 fixtures: 0<br/>

<p>The data we will be using is taken from another REST api.<br/>
So, first we need to fetch it from there to our database.<br/>
In order to load the data:
<ol>
	<li>click the link <i>Load Data</i></li>
	<li>Enter the token sent to you in the mail</li>
	<li>Push one of the buttons and see how the status changes</li>
</ol>
</p> 
<p>The call to the web service is asynchronous.<br/>
So you would see the web service status changes to "success", when the call to the web service is done, before the results are back.<br/>
The status below that shows the number of records in each of the tables will change when the data is actually loaded.
</p>
<p>
After loading the data, you can test the next two links, showing the standings (league table), and team vs. team fixtures.
